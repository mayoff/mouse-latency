To compile this Teensy program, you need the [LUFA](http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php) library.  I used [LUFA 120219 BETA](http://lufa-lib.googlecode.com/files/LUFA-120219-BETA.zip).  You need to make the `lufa` symlink point to the root of the LUFA directory tree.

You also need an AVR cross-compiler and C library.  I used [CrossPack](http://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/index.html), a Mac OS X package.
